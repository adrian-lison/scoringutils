\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame that follows the same specifications outlined in
\code{\link[=eval_forecasts]{eval_forecasts()}}. The data.frame needs to have columns called
"true_value", "prediction" and then either a column called sample, or one
called "quantile" or two columns called "range" and "boundary". Internally,
these will be separated into a truth and forecast data set in order to be
able to apply different filtering to truth data and forecasts. Alternatively
you can directly provide a separate truth and forecasts data frame as input.
These data sets, however, need to be mergeable, in order to connect forecasts
and truth data for plotting.}

\item{forecasts}{data.frame with forecasts, that should follow the same
general guidelines as the \code{data} input. Argument can be used to supply
forecasts and truth data independently. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{truth_data}{data.frame with a column called \code{true_value}
on the x-axis. Usually, this will be "date", but it can be anything else.}

\item{merge_by}{character vector with column names that \code{forecasts} and
\code{truth_data} should be merged on. Default is \code{NULL} and merge will be
attempted automatically.}

\item{x}{character vector of length one that denotes the name of the variable}

\item{filter_truth}{a list with character strings that are used to filter
the truth data. Every element is parsed as an expression and evaluated
in order to filter the truth data.}

\item{filter_forecasts}{a list with character strings that are used to filter
the truth data. Every element is parsed as an expression and evaluated
in order to filter the forecasts data.}

\item{filter_both}{same as \code{filter_truth} and \code{filter_forecasts}, but
applied to both data sets for convenience.}

\item{range}{numeric vector indicating the interval ranges to plot. If 0 is
included in range, the median prediction will be shown.}

\item{facet_formula}{formula for facetting in ggplot. If this is \code{NULL}
(the default), no facetting will take place}

\item{facet_wrap_or_grid}{Use ggplot2's \code{facet_wrap} or
\code{facet_grid}? Anything other than "facet_wrap" will be interpreted as
\code{facet_grid}. This only takes effect if \code{facet_formula} is not
\code{NULL}}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns for facet wrap. Only relevant if
\code{facet_formula} is given and \code{facet_wrap_or_grid == "facet_wrap"}}

\item{scales}{scales argument that gets passed down to ggplot. Only necessary
if you make use of facetting. Default is "free_y"}

\item{allow_truth_without_pred}{logical, whether or not
to allow instances where there is truth data, but no forecast. If \code{FALSE}
(the default), these get filtered out.}

\item{remove_from_truth}{character vector of columns to remove from the
truth data. The reason these columns are removed is that sometimes different
models or forecasters don't cover the same periods. Removing these columns
from the truth data makes sure that nevertheless all available truth data
is plotted (instead of having different true values depending on the
period covered by a certain model).}

\item{xlab}{Label for the x-axis. Default is the variable name on the x-axis}

\item{ylab}{Label for the y-axis. Default is "True and predicted values"}

\item{zoom_multiple_data}{Named vector with names \code{ymin} and/or
\code{ymax}. If fiven, forecasts will be limited to minimally/maximally
the given multiple of the data, repsectively. For example, \code{ymax = 3}
will cut forecasts that go beyond 2 times the highest data point from view.}

\item{expand_limits}{Named list to pass to \code{expand_limits}, if given}

\item{verbose}{print out additional helpful messages (default is TRUE)}
